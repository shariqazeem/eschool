                and the provincial governments, whereas the federal government mostly assists in curriculum development,
                accreditation and in the financing of research and development. Article 25-A of Constitution of Pakistan
                obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education to children of the age group 5 to
                16 years. "The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to
                sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law".</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Most schools also offer drama studies, music and physical education but
                these are usually not examined or marked. Home economics is sometimes taught to female students, whereas
                topics related to astronomy, environmental management and psychology are frequently included in
                textbooks of general science. Sometimes archaeology and anthropology are extensively taught in textbooks
                of social studies. SRE is not taught at most schools in Pakistan although this trend is being rebuked by
                some urban schools.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">As of 2007, public expenditure on education was 2.2 percent of GNPs, a
                marginal increase from 2 percent before 1984â€“85. Very little (only about 12%) of the total national
                allocation to education goes to higher education with about 88% being spent on lower level education.
                Lower education institutions such as primary schools suffer under such conditions as the lower income
                classes are unable to enjoy subsidies and quality education.</p>
